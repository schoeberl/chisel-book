Class scrbook Warning: \float@addtolists detected!
(scrbook)              Implementation of \float@addtolist became
(scrbook)              deprecated in KOMA-Script v3.01 2008/11/14 and
(scrbook)              has been replaced by several more flexible
(scrbook)              features of package `tocbasic`.
(scrbook)              Since Version 3.12 support for deprecated
(scrbook)              \float@addtolist interface has been
(scrbook)              restricted to only some of the KOMA-Script
(scrbook)              features and been removed from others.
(scrbook)              Loading of package `scrhack' may help to
(scrbook)              avoid this warning, if you are using a
(scrbook)              a package that still implements the
(scrbook)              deprecated \float@addtolist interface .

Class scrbook Warning: deprecated old font command `\bf' used.
(scrbook)              You should note, that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a
(scrbook)              new font selection scheme called NFSS2 with several
(scrbook)              new, combinable font commands. New KOMA-Script classes
(scrbook)              defined the old font commands like `\bf' only for
(scrbook)              compatibility with LaTeX 2.09 document styles of
(scrbook)              Script 2.0. These commands are deprecated and
(scrbook)              undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013,
(scrbook)              KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of
(scrbook)              these deprecated commands. Now, after two decades of
(scrbook)              LaTeX2e, NFSS2, and KOMA-Script these commands will
(scrbook)              not work any longer. If loading a package results in
(scrbook)              this message you should contact the author of that
(scrbook)              package and ask him to replace the depracted font
(scrbook)              command `\bf', e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries '.
(scrbook)              Otherwise you should reconfigure or replace the
(scrbook)              package. If you have used the old font command
(scrbook)              `\bf' yourself you should replace it, e.g., by
(scrbook)              `\normalfont \bfseries ' on input line 419.
